> We present a novel method for question answering which infers on both structured and unstructured resources. Our method consists of two main steps as outlined in §2. In the first step we extract answers for a given question using a structured KB (here Freebase) by jointly performing entity linking and relation extraction (§3). In the next step we validate these answers using an unstructured resource (here Wikipedia) to prune out the wrong answers and select the correct ones.

本文是基于IE的方法的，核心步骤为：

1.  KB-based joint inference
2.  Wiki-based inference

具体又分为四个步骤：

1. Entity Linking
2. Relation Extraction
3. KB-based joint inference
4. Wiki-based inference (refinement model)
